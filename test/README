This directory contains a number of tests for modjewel-require.

Use the testers.html to launch all the tests from links.

- commonjs contain tests from http://github.com/kriskowal/commonjs

- set-exports contains tests for the require.setExports() function

- preload contains some tests for the preload facility

The tests in commonjs and set-exports are tested by opening the
modjewel-require-test.html file in a browser.  

The tests in preload are run differently.  See the README in that directory
for more information.
